## Introduction

Meet a 21-year-old developer from Australia, [Thomas](https://x.com/thamiltonsmith1), who transformed a childhood idea into a viable project management product tailored for developers.

In this article, we'll explore Thomas's background, his tool [Frostbyte](https://getfrostbyte.dev/), and the key lessons from his experience, from balancing studies and side projects to using AI tools for faster development. Let’s get started!

## From Childhood Dream to Actual Product: The Journey of a Young Developer

Thomas started coding at the age of 12 and had a long-standing idea for a project management tool designed specifically for developers. Despite being only 21, he had already dedicated months to building Frostbyte, a project planning app that aims to streamline how developers organize and track their projects.

He shares, "I had this idea about 8 years ago when I was really young. Back then, I didn't have the technical skills to build it. But over the last few months, I decided to focus on turning that idea into reality."

**Key takeaway:** Start early, even with small ideas; consistent effort turns dreams into reality.

## Managing Time: Balancing Studies and Side Projects

One of the biggest challenges Thomas faced was balancing university commitments with his side projects. He explains, "During the semester, I consolidate my classes into one or two days per week to free up time for development."

He emphasizes the importance of strategic planning: "I try to schedule my classes so I have solid blocks of free time during the week, and I do my best to fit in side work whenever I can." His approach shows that with careful time management, it's possible to juggle studies, part-time work, and personal projects.

**Actionable tip:**

Organize your schedule to consolidate academic work, freeing up larger chunks of time for development or entrepreneurial pursuits.

## Building Frostbyte: An App Designed for Developers' Needs

Thomas's product, Frostbyte, is a project management app tailored for developers and their teams. Unlike traditional tools like Trello or Jira, which Thomas found too bloated and expensive for his needs, Frostbyte aims to be simpler, more flexible, and developer-focused.

He describes, "Frostbyte allows you to break projects into tasks, areas, and releases. It helps you plan your work efficiently, avoiding the trap of trying to do everything at once." The app features include:

- ✔️ Versioning of features (e.g., MVP, version 1.2, 1.2.1)
- ✔️ Kanban boards for task management
- ✔️ Grouping tasks by areas like technical, marketing, or legal
- ✔️ Integration with GitHub to sync issues and pull requests
- ✔️ Feedback portal for user bug reports and feature suggestions
- ✔️ And more!

Thomas built Frostbyte with the goal of providing a streamlined alternative that costs less and offers better tailored features for developers and small teams.

**Insight:**

Focus your product design on solving specific pain points of your target audience, in this case, streamlining project planning for developers.

## How AI Tools Accelerated Development and Enhanced Quality

An aspect of Thomas's journey is his use of AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude Code. He mentions, "Since the release of these large AI models, software development has shifted dramatically. I used AI to speed up coding, where months of work took weeks or even days."

He shares, "Using AI helped me add new features rapidly. Tasks that previously took months, I completed in just a couple of weeks." Despite leveraging AI, Thomas emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying technology.

**Lesson:**

Don't rely solely on AI; use it to complement your skills and understanding, enhancing both efficiency and quality.

## Future Plans: Expanding Projects

He is also working on a side project called Roll Call, a social app for daily challenges and punishments among friends, which has gained over a thousand downloads. These ventures showcase a young entrepreneur exploring diverse ideas, balancing multiple projects, and leveraging marketing through social media.

**Key insight:**

Always look for ways to innovate and expand your product using new technology, while managing multiple projects with clear priorities.

## Final Thoughts

Thomas's story proves that age is just a number when it comes to creating impactful software. His combination of curiosity, technical skills, strategic planning, and innovative use of AI tools allowed him to build and grow Frostbyte while still in his early twenties.

If you're inspired to turn your ideas into real products, remember:

- ✔️ Start early, even with small ideas
- ✔️ Manage your time intentionally
- ✔️ Focus on solving real problems
- ✔️ Leverage AI to boost productivity, but learn the fundamentals first
- ✔️ Keep exploring new features and markets
