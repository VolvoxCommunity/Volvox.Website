## Introduction

Are you curious about how artificial intelligence is reshaping the world of coding and development? As AI tools become more prevalent, many developers question what it means for beginners, experienced programmers, and the industry as a whole. In this article, you'll discover practical insights from Brad, a seasoned software developer, about the evolving landscape of AI in coding, its challenges, opportunities, and future implications.

### Q&A

In this Q&A, I (Eleftheria, Developer Advocate at Volvox) interview Brad. This article summarizes his answers. For the full conversation, watch his full [interview](https://youtu.be/7ShrNuwNIcc).

**Eleftheria:** How is AI affecting entry-level programming jobs?

**Brad:** AI automates routine coding tasks, meaning fewer entry-level positions are available because some of the work juniors typically do can now be handled by AI tools. This reduces the pathways for beginners to gain initial experience.

**Eleftheria:** Does AI impact skill development for junior developers?

**Brad:** While AI increases productivity, it can inadvertently hinder skill development. Some junior developers over-rely on AI, neglecting the critical thinking necessary to truly grow and learn. This reliance can lead to stagnation, where developers aren't progressing because they're not challenging themselves enough.

**Eleftheria:** Is AI's current hype sustainable, or is it a bubble?

**Brad:** Large investments flow into AI companies, but profitability remains uncertain. For AI to be truly successful and sustainable, it will need to target specific, valuable industries, beyond coding or general consumer use. Profitable AI applications will likely emerge in specialized fields where AI provides clear, measurable value.

**Eleftheria:** Should developers stick with familiar tools or explore new AI options?

**Brad:** Unless there's a compelling reason to switch, it's advisable to become highly proficient with tools you already trust. Established tools like Cloud Code, Codex, or Cursor have proven track records. While experimenting with new tools can be beneficial, it's wise to wait until a tool demonstrates clear advantages.

**Eleftheria:** What AI tools do you recommend for developers?

**Brad:** My preferred AI tools are Claude Code for its reliability, alongside Cursor and CodeX. Consistency and mastery over a few reliable tools trump constantly switching.

**💡Note:** Brad answered more questions, you can find them on our YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/7ShrNuwNIcc).

### Conclusion

The integration of AI into software development holds enormous promise but also presents challenges, particularly for newcomers and those still mastering core skills. By understanding the current landscape, adopting proven tools, and approaching new innovations with curiosity and caution, you can navigate this evolving terrain successfully.
