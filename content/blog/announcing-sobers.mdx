**Track the journey, not just the days.**

Recovery is hard. Really hard. And while there are plenty of apps that count your sober days, we noticed something missing: tools that actually support the sponsor-sponsee relationship at the heart of 12-step programs. Counting days is important, but it's only part of the picture.

Today, we're launching Sobers—a comprehensive accountability app that empowers sponsors and sponsees to work together through structured task management, sobriety tracking, and visual progress timelines. Because recovery isn't just about the destination; it's about the journey.

## Built for Real Recovery

Let's be honest: recovery isn't a straight line. There are setbacks, breakthroughs, and everything in between. Sobers embraces this reality with transparent relapse tracking—no shame, no judgment, just honest documentation that preserves your entire journey history.

Your visual timeline shows more than a number. It displays milestones, completed tasks, step progress, and yes, the difficult moments too. Because real recovery requires real honesty, and your story deserves to be told completely.

## For Sponsors: Powerful Accountability Tools

As a sponsor, you're guiding someone through one of the most challenging journeys of their life. Sobers gives you the tools to do it effectively:

- **Secure Invite System**: Generate a unique 8-character invite code to connect with your sponsees. It's like a friend code, but for accountability instead of Mario Kart.
- **Task Assignment**: Create tasks with optional due dates to help structure your sponsee's recovery work.
- **Timeline Monitoring**: View your sponsee's complete journey—sobriety progress, completed tasks, and milestones—all in one place.
- **Multiple Sponsees**: Support as many people as you're called to help. No artificial limits on making a difference.

## For Sponsees: Track Your Journey

Your recovery is yours to own. Sobers helps you document every step:

- **Continuous Sobriety Tracking**: Log your sobriety with the honesty your recovery deserves. If setbacks happen, you can document them transparently while preserving your complete history.
- **Task Completion**: Complete sponsor-assigned tasks and add private notes about your experience. Your growth, your words.
- **Visual Progress**: Watch your journey unfold through milestones, step completion, and your personal timeline.
- **Complete History**: Access your entire recovery journey anytime. Every milestone earned, every task completed, every day counted.

## Universal Support for All 12-Step Programs

AA, NA, CA, OA, GA—if it has 12 steps and accountability partners, Sobers has you covered. The features work universally because recovery principles are universal. We're not here to tell you how to work your program; we're here to help you track it.

And yes, you can be both a sponsor and a sponsee. No role restrictions here—you can guide others while receiving guidance yourself. Just like real 12-step programs, except the app won't ask you to make coffee.

## Available Everywhere You Need It

Recovery doesn't wait for convenient moments. That's why Sobers is available across all your devices:

## Completely Free, Forever

No ads. No premium tiers. No "unlock your third milestone for $4.99."

We believe recovery tools should be accessible to everyone—your sobriety journey has enough obstacles without a paywall. Your data stays private too: sobriety information and personal notes are only visible to you and your connected sponsor. We never share your information with third parties. What happens in your recovery stays in your recovery.
