Four years ago, on January 2, 2020, Volvox was born from a simple idea: what if we could build great software while simultaneously fostering the next generation of developers? Today, I'm proud to share our journey and vision with the world.

## More Than a Dev Shop

Volvox isn't just another dev shop. We're a community where experienced developers mentor aspiring programmers through real-world open source projects. Every line of code we write serves dual purposes - delivering value to our users and providing learning opportunities for our community members.

## Learning by Building

Our mentorship program pairs seasoned developers with those just starting their journey. Mentees contribute to actual production codebases, learning industry best practices, modern tooling, and collaborative development workflows. It's learning by doing, with expert guidance every step of the way.

We believe the best way to learn programming is by building real things that matter. Welcome to Volvox - where we build, learn, and grow together.
