Almost six years ago in 2020, Volvox was born from a simple idea: what if we could build great software while simultaneously fostering the next generation of developers? Today, I'm proud to share our journey and vision with the world.

## More Than a Dev Shop

Volvox isn't just another dev shop. We're a community where experienced developers mentor aspiring programmers through real-world open source projects. Every line of code we write serves dual purposes - delivering value to our users and providing learning opportunities for our community members.

## Learning by Building

Our mentorship program pairs seasoned developers with those just starting their journey. Mentees contribute to actual production codebases, learning industry best practices, modern tooling, and collaborative development workflows. It's learning by doing, with expert guidance every step of the way.

## Join Our Community on Discord

Learning to code can feel isolating, especially when you're stuck on a problem at 2 AM. That's why we've launched our official Discord server - a space where the Volvox community can connect, collaborate, and support each other in real-time.

### Dedicated Channels for Every Need

Our Discord server features dedicated channels for different topics: general discussion, code help, project showcases, career advice, and more. Mentors are active throughout the day, ready to help troubleshoot issues, review code, or discuss best practices.

### More Than Just Work

But it's not all work. We also have channels for celebrating wins, sharing memes, and just hanging out with fellow developers. Building a supportive community means creating space for both learning and connection.

## Get Started Today

Whether you're considering joining our mentorship program, contributing to our open source projects, or just want to chat with like-minded developers, we'd love to have you. Join us at [discord.gg/8ahXACdamN](https://discord.gg/8ahXACdamN) and introduce yourself!

We believe the best way to learn programming is by building real things that matter. Welcome to Volvox - where we build, learn, and grow together.
