**Hey everyone**

I'm Eleftheria (you can call me Elef), and I'm thrilled to officially join the Volvox team as we build out the social presence and help grow this awesome developer community.

A bit about my journey: I started my career as a front-end developer, diving deep into JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular and Vue.js (yeap, no React!). I loved crafting user interfaces, solving real UX problems, and seeing code come to life in the browser.

[These](https://codepen.io/EleftheriaBatsou) are my real - honest attempts to code!

## My background

Over time, I evolved into Developer Relations (DevRel) and community management, roles where I could combine my coding background with helping others grow. That shift happened naturally: I found huge joy in sharing knowledge, whether through [writing articles](https://dev.to/eleftheriabatsou), creating [educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/@EleftheriaBatsou), or speaking at meetups and [conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJkWgeJ59lg&list=PLxktx98zP3aCYRP1-HCUgyHE3qowkQ01A). Public speaking became a big passion (I've MC'd events like [Frontend Nation](https://frontendnation.com/) and organized [local meetups](https://www.meetup.com/skg-js/events/)), and I love turning complex topics into clear, actionable content (tutorials, threads, videos, you name it).

I've contributed to platforms like Vue School, Hashnode, Packt, Cosine, CrabNebula and more, always with the goal of making tech more approachable and helping devs level up. Now, at Volvox, I'm excited to bring that energy here. I'll be handling our [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/volvox_llc), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/volvoxllc/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@volvox_llc) channels (with more video content coming soon, check out our [initiative here](https://discord.com/channels/1438631180474781909/1439115183275511878/1461347413183959060)!), and we'll be expanding to Facebook before long. I'll also be active daily in [Discord](https://discord.gg/8ahXACdamN)—checking in, chatting, moderating if needed, and keeping the vibes positive and supportive. My DMs are always open, whether you want to share your project for feedback, brainstorm ideas, ask about DevRel/community stuff, or just say hi.

Let's connect, collaborate, and keep building together. Looking forward to meeting more of you, hearing your stories, and contributing to Volvox's mission of purpose-driven software + real mentorship.
