At Volvox, we believe in using the right tools for the job. Our tech stack reflects our commitment to modern, type-safe development practices that prioritize developer experience and code quality.

## Web Development

For web applications, we primarily use React with TypeScript. The combination provides excellent developer tooling, catches errors before runtime, and makes collaboration easier through clear type definitions. We style with Tailwind CSS v4, which offers rapid development without sacrificing customization.

## Mobile Development

Our mobile apps are built with React Native and Expo, allowing us to share code between iOS and Android while maintaining native performance. This approach also means our mentees can leverage their React knowledge across platforms.

## UI Components

We use shadcn/ui for component libraries, giving us beautiful, accessible components that we can customize to match each project's needs. For state management, we keep it simple with React hooks and context, only reaching for heavier solutions when truly necessary.

## Development Workflow

Our development workflow emphasizes version control with Git, collaborative code review on GitHub, and continuous learning. Every technology choice we make considers not just the end product, but the learning journey for our community members.
