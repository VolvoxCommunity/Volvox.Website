## Introduction

I had the pleasure of hosting Levario, a former heavy equipment operator turned programmer—or as he likes to call himself, a vibe coder—who shares his inspiring journey into the world of AI agents, game development, and more!

## Levario’s Story and Projects

Levario introduces his groundbreaking projects, including the [RPG MCP server](https://github.com/Mnehmos/mnehmos.ooda.mcp), a [roguelite procedural game](https://mnehmos.github.io/mnehmos.long-hall.game/), the innovative [ProveCalc](http://provecalc.com/) engineering tool (WIP), and more. These projects highlight the transformative potential of AI in creating dynamic, generative gaming experiences and underscore the importance of community and continuous learning in tech development.

Levario's work with the RPG MCP server showcases a model context protocol that enhances AI's ability to handle structured data, offering a seamless gaming experience where players can interact with a procedurally generated world. His roguelite game, "The Long Hall," exemplifies the power of AI in generating endless possibilities, while ProveCalc provides engineers with a robust tool for validating calculations.

We also discussed the value of tools like [natural language source](https://github.com/Mnehmos/mnehmos.nls.lang) (an upcoming project), which simplifies coding by breaking down complex tasks into understandable units. Levario emphasizes the need for tools that allow AI to reason over structured data, enhancing its role as both an assistant and an on-demand tutor.
