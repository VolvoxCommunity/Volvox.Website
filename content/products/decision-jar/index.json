    {
      "question": "Why should I trust a random selection?",
      "answer": "Science says we make around 35,000 decisions daily. Decision fatigue is real. For low-stakes choices like what to have for dinner, random selection conserves mental energy for decisions that actually matter. Plus, if you don't like the result, you can always shake again."
