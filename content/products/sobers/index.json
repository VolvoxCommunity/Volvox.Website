Built with React Native and Expo for seamless cross-platform performance on iOS, Android, and Web.",

    {
      "question": "Is Sobers free to use?",
      "answer": "Completely free. No ads, no premium tiers, no 'unlock your third milestone for $4.99.' We believe recovery tools should be accessible to everyone—your sobriety journey has enough obstacles without a paywall."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I connect with my sponsor?",
      "answer": "Your sponsor generates a unique 8-character invite code from their profile. Enter it in your app, and you're connected. It's like a friend code, but for accountability instead of Mario Kart."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Sobers without a sponsor?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use Sobers without a sponsor. You can still track your sobriety, complete tasks, and visualize your progress. You can also connect with a sponsor later."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "Your sobriety data and personal notes are only visible to you and your connected sponsor. We never share your information with third parties. What happens in your recovery stays in your recovery."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I be both a sponsor and a sponsee?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. No role restrictions here—you can guide others while receiving guidance yourself. Just like real 12-step programs, except the app won't ask you to make coffee."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I relapse?",
      "answer": "Recovery isn't a straight line. You can honestly document relapses, which resets your counter but preserves your entire journey history. No shame, no judgment—just transparent tracking, because real recovery requires real honesty."
    },
    {
      "question": "What 12-step programs does the app support?",
      "answer": "All of them-or none at all. AA, NA, CA, OA, GA—if it has 12 steps and accountability partners, we've got you covered. The features work universally because recovery principles are universal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What platforms is Sobers available on?",
      "answer": "iOS, Android, and Web. Your data syncs across all platforms, so you can check in whether you're on your phone, tablet, or pretending to work at your computer."
